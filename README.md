# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses Babel
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses SWC

## React Compiler
The React Compiler is not enabled in this template because of its impact on dev & build performance.

## Expanding the ESLint configuration
If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled.
